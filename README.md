# Squirrel-Foraging-Model-2026
Mathematical model of squirrel risk-assessment near Pace 303 Bus Stop using Python and Doppler Effect analysis.

Project: Squirrel Behavioral Math (Feb 2026)This project models squirrel foraging distances ($x$) relative to traffic noise at the Pace 303 Bus Stop.

Key Features:Metabolic Calibration: Adjusting for Chicago winter temperatures (9°F to 26°F).

Doppler Integration: Modeling the "Fear Shift" as buses approach vs. depart.

Sensors used: Phyphox (Doppler/Frequency) and Decibel X (Amplitude).
